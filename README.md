## War or Peace

This is the starter repo for the BE Mod1 **War or Peace** project.


# Game Play/Rules (based on this [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_(card_game)))

**Objective:** to win all of the cards

**Set Up:** divide the deck evenly between two players

**Game Play:**
- Each player start with their deck face down
- Each player simultaneously reveals a card and a **_"battle"_** starts
- Highest card wins the battle
    - _is Ace high or low?_
- The player that wins the battle takes all cards in play
- In case of a tie a **_war_** begins
    - Each player puts 1 (_or 3?_) cards face down and then 1 face up
    - the highest card wins all the cards in play
- _What happens if a player runs out of cards in the middle of war?_
- Game ends when one player has all the cards


_Interesting fact_: Some game designers argue this is not actually a _game_ because the players make no decisions and the outcome is purely based on luck
